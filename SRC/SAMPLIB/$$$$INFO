*    Member $$$$$DOC in this library is the original documentation of
*    the ESG Security System as prepared by Sam Golob in 1991. It is
*    retained here as a historic reference although it is no longer
*    current in some aspects due to the changes introduced by RAKF to
*    achieve MVS 3.8j compatibility.
*
*    The current RAKF documentation is the "RAKF Version 1 Release 2
*    Modifaction 0 User's Guide" which is available in two formats:
*
*    o Microsoft Word 2010 .docx:        The source document ("original
*                                        copy") and base for further
*                                        evolutions.
*
*    o Portable Document Format (PDF/A): Display and printer friendly
*                                        format intended for reading or
*                                        printing the document using
*                                        publicly available no-cost
*                                        software (Adobe Acrobat Reader).
*
*    These two formats are available as member $DOC$ZIP in this library
*    which is a zip archive containing the two files "Users_Guide.docx"
*    and "Users_Guide.pdf". This member is intended to be downloaded in
*    binary format to the user's PC using the 3270 terminal emulation's
*    file transfer function (typically based on IND$FILE) or any other
*    suitable method.
*
*    Once downloaded, the User's Guide can be extracted in the desired
*    format (.pdf or .docx) using the PC's standard unzip utility for
*    reading or printing using Word, Acrobat Reader or other tools
*    compatible with these formats.
