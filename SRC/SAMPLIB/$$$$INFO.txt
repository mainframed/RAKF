*    let RAKF be installed and active and replace the profiles table
*    by the minimum table MINPRF from this library. This enables ALTER

Version History
===============

ESG Security System (March 1991):
---------------------------------
The ESG Security System was published by Craig J. Yasuna as an alternative to
IBM's RACF and similar products. It uses the ICHRTX00 security router exit to
communicate it's security decisions to MVS. ICHRTX00 is a user exit of the SAF
router ICHSFR00.

RAKF "RAcK oF" Security System (August 2005):
---------------------------------------------

RAKF was published by A. Philip Dickinson as an adaption of the ESG Security
System to MVS 3.8j. The ESG Security doesn't natively support MVS 3.8j for
several reasons. The major ones are:

o At MVS 3.8j times the SAF router ICHSFR00 was part of the RACF product and
  thus not a available on MVS systems without RACF being installed. So the
  ICHRTX00 exit as a convenient place for third party security products to hook
  into the SAF didn't exist.

o incompatible ACEE handling.

o The ESG Security System uses the BAS instruction which is not available
  in S/370.

o ESG Security's 24/31 bit AMODE handling wasn't compatible with the usage of
  high order address bytes for flags in MVS 3.8j.

o incompatible parameter lists of RACROUTE, RACDEF, RACHECK and RACINIT.

o handling of in core profiles incompatible with MVS's VSAM catalog management.

Phil D. converted ESG Security's ICHRTX00 router exit into an ICHSFR00 SAF
router to overcome the first major incompatibility. He also solved the next two
points and in parts the 24/31 bit AMODE issues. The rest remained undetected
when he published his work and caused several problems when using RAKF on
MVS 3.8j:

o Arbitrary 0C4 abends during RACINIT and RACDEF processing. The most
  severe of these abends is the "initiator blowout" mentioned in
  http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/H390-MVS/message/10015.

o Arbitrary 0C4 abends and FREEMAIN errors during RACHECK processing
  of VSAM catalogs and objects. These problems are discussed in
  http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/H390-MVS/message/11811.

o Arbitrary invalid authorization decisions: Access denied if it
  should have been granted and access granted if it should have been
  denied. The latter in a way that with some trial and error any user
  is able to acquire ALTER access to any dataset in the system.

RAKF 1.2.0 (April 2011):
------------------------

When the above mentioned problems became visible and identified as being
RAKF caused in several MVS 3.8j environments it turned out that Phil D's RAKF
source wasn't accessible any more (lost in a package crate from moving). Phil
Roberts ("halfmeg") stepped in and reconstructed the source by disassembling
Phil D's binary RAKF distribution and comparing it with the original source of
the ESG Security System. Based on that reconstructed source the rest of the
incompatibilities listed above were identified and corrected by Juergen
Winkelmann.

To avoid another loss of the source to occur an additional effort has been made
to clean up the source to a publishable state and to provide an SMP4 compatible
source distribution enabling RAKF installation through the well known SMP 4
standard RECEIVE, APPLY, ACCEPT procedure.
