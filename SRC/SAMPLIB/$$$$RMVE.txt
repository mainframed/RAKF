                   RAKF 1.2.0 Deinstallation Instructions
                   ======================================

This document describes the steps to deinstall RAKF 1.2.0 and

DEINSTALLING RAKF IS NOT RECOMMENDED!

After deinstallation RACF indicated files will no longer be
accessible. This may lead to a not IPLable or not accessible
system. Removing RAKF and reinstating native MVS security
behavior is NOT RECOMMENDED unless in preparation the RACF
indicator of all non VSAM datasets, VSAM catalogs and VSAM
objects has been turned off.

The RECOMMENDED WAY instead of deinstalling RAKF is to let it
be installed and active and replace the profiles table by the
minimum table MINPRF from this library. This enables ALTER
access by everyone to everything and thus is accesswise
equivalent to a vanilla MVS system without RAKF.

DEINSTALLING RAKF IS NOT RECOMMENDED!

The following instructions assume that you've read the above
recommendation and understood the consequences of removing RAKF
from your system. Continue at your own risk:

1. If you've applied the MVS ZAPs using job ZAPMVS38 consult member
   $$$$M38J on how to remove these ZAPs. The ZAPs MUST be removed
   prior to deinstalling RAKF otherwise the system will not be
   accessible or will not even IPL after the deinstallation.

2. Copy members $$$$RMVE (this instruction), $$$$INST, C@APPLY,
   RAKFRMV and RAKF2MVS from your RAKF SAMPLIB to a private library.
   Work with these copies throughout the following steps as the RAKF
   libraries will be deleted! The jobs to be edited and submitted in
   the course of this procedure have been prepared under the assumption
   that the libraries to be deleted or modified can be located through
   the standard catalog search order. If this is not the case look
   thoroughly through the JCL to be sure to add VOL and/or UNIT parameters
   to the DD statements to correctly identify the libraries.

3. a) If RAKF SYSMOD TRKF120 has been APPLIed but not ACCEPTed,
      edit installation job C@APPLY:
      o change all occurances of HLQ to the high level qualifier of your
        RAKF libraries, e.g. RAKF, RAKF.V1R2M0, etc. and verify the
        correct sequence of the overiding DD statements against your
        SMPAPP procedure as described in $$$$INST.
      o change the command "APPLY S(TRKF120) DIS(WRITE)" in line 30 to
        read "RESTORE S(TRKF120) DIS(WRITE)".
      Submit changed job C@APPLY to remove all RAKF components from
      your system.

   b) If RAKF SYSMOD TRKF120 has been ACCEPTed, edit job RAKFRMV:
      o change all occurances of tttt to the device type and all occurances
        of rrrrrr to the volume of the sysres device where SYS1.LPALIB and
        SYS1.LINKLIB of the system reside from which RAKF is to be deleted.
        (If you are running TK3 MVS and delete from your current system the
        device type is 3350 and the volume is MVSRES.)
      Submit changed job RAKFRMV to remove all RAKF components from
      your system.

4. Review the DD statements pointing to SYS1.LINKLIB and SYS1.LPALIB in
   job RAKF2MVS and add VOL and/or UNIT parameters if necessary. Change
   all occurances of HLQ to the high level qualifier of your RAKF libraries.
   Submit the job which concludes the deinstallation procedure.

The system libraries as well as SMP are now reverted back to native MVS
security. Before activating this configuration through an IPL CLPA make
sure that no dataset needed for IPL is RACF indicated.
