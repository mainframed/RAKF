                    RAKF 1.2.0 Installation Instructions
                    ====================================

This document describes the steps to install RAKF 1.2.0.

The installation is performed through the standard SMP RECEIVE, APPLY and
ACCEPT procedure. The process has been tested with SMP level 04.48 which
is the level provided by the Turnkey 3 MVS system. This presumably is equivalent
to having PTFs UR13349, UR15994, UR17644 and UR19590 applied. Tests have
shown that APPLY processing doesn't work reliably at lower levels: For
example at level 04.44 APPLY doesn't assemble and link all modules. So
before starting please update your SMP as close to level 04.48 as possible.

1. Edit jobs A@PREP, C@APPLY and D@ACCPT:

   o change all occurances of HLQ to the desired high level qualifier
     for the RAKF libraries, e.g. RAKF, RAKF.V1R2M0, etc. Please note
     that HLQs where HLQ.SAMPLIB, HLQ.ASAMPLIB, HLQ.APROCLIB, HLQ.APARMLIB
     HLQ.MACLIB, HLQ.AMACLIB, HLQ.SRCLIB or HLQ.ASRCLIB already exist
     are not recommended.
   o change all occurances of dddddd to the desired volume for the
     RAKF distribution libraries.
   o change all occurances of ssssss to the desired volume for the
     RAKF target libraries.
   o change all occurances of tttt to the device type and all occurances
     of rrrrrr to the volume of the sysres device where SYS1.LPALIB and
     SYS1.LINKLIB of the system reside on which RAKF is to be installed.
     (If you are running TK3 MVS and install on your current system the
     device type is 3350 and the volume is MVSRES.)

   Verify that in jobs C@APPLY and D@ACCPT the sequence of the SYSLIB and
   the target and distribution library DD statements matches your
   SMPAPP and SMPACC procedures. The jobs have been tested with the
   SMP procedures as defined in Volker's MVS TK3 system. If the sequence
   of DD statements in the SMP procedures in your system doesn't match
   the sequence of the overriding DD statements in C@APPLY and D@ACCPT
   RAKF elements may erroneously be placed in SYS1.ASAMPLIB, SYS1.SAMPLIB,
   SYS1.APROCLIB, SYS1.APARMLIB, SYS1.AMACLIB or SYS1.MACLIB instead of
   their HLQ.xxxxLIB counterparts.

2. Submit job A@PREP. This job performs the following actions to prepare
   your system for RAKF 1.2.0 installation:

   o Delete MODs and LMODs that are defined in MVS 3.8j as placeholders for
     RACF modules from SMP's target and distribution zones.
   o Delete the placeholder modules as well as potentialy installed
     pre RAKF 1.2.0 modules from SYS1.LINKLIB and SYS1.LPALIB.
   o Allocate RAKF 1.2.0 target and distribution libraries.

3. Receive RAKF by submitting job B@RECV. Be prepared to mount the RAKF
   distribution tape rakf12.aws after submitting the job.

4. Apply RAKF by submitting job C@APPLY.

5. Accept RAKF by submitting job D@ACCPT. This step can be skipped if
   you don't want to accept the sysmod now. It is, however, strongly
   recommended to accept it as only then it will be possible to "test
   drive" updates that might be published later and to return to the
   previous state in case of problems.

6. Perform an IPL CLPA of your system. The system will come up with all
   RAKF elements installed but without activating RAKF. Successful
   installation can be verified from the RAKF banner being displayed
   at the beginning of the IPL and by checking the system's SVC table
   for example using menu option T in IMON and scroll forward to the
   RACF SVCs (130 - 133) which should show entries like this:

   130 82 00EAEB30 3/4        RACHECK    -RACF IGC00130 RAKF  mm/dd/yy
   131 83 00EAEB52 3/4 YES    RACINIT    -RACF IGC0013A RAKF  mm/dd/yy
   132 84 00EAEB74 3/4 YES    RACLIST    -RACF ICHRIN00 DUMMY mm/dd/yy
   133 85 00EAEB9A 3/4 YES    RACDEF     -RACF IGC0013C RAKF  mm/dd/yy

   where mm/dd/yy is RAKF's installation date.

7. Consult member $$$$CUST in HLQ.SAMPLIB for information on how
   to customize and activate RAKF and member $$$$INFO for various
   other aspects around RAKF usage and background informations.
